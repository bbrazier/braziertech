# AWS Lamp

## Challenge

Provide a Cloudformation template defining a redundant, secure and cost effective LAMP stack within AWS.

## Response

- Provide documentation describing your environment
- Provide a link to a public git repository hosting the template (committing frequently so we can see how your solution progressed) 

## Stretch Goal

- Provide a small application that will run on the infrastructure (written in PHP that connects to the MySQL database)  

Notes: Apache, PHP or MySQL not your thing? Feel free to swap any of these out for an alternate technology.
